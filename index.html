            <h1>Brian Topcu-Alterescu</h1>
            <p>Iâ€™m 17 years old. Just a boy from New York who enjoyed taking pictures on his iPhone. Then I got a better
                iPhone with a better camera. I took a photography class in high school and I enjoyed it so much I bought
                myself a Canon Rebel EOS T3. Once I did that I took a Pre-College Course at the Fashion Institute of
                Technology in New York City. I met others my age who were, like me, also interested in photography. I
                used that opportunity to make new friends and learn new camera techniques. I gained a lot from that
                experience.</p>
            <h3> Skills </h3>
            <p> Basic JavaScript / Basic HTML / Basic CSS / Intermediate Lightroom  </p>
